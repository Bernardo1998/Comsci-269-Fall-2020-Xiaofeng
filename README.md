# Gradient Based CRAIG
Project conducted by Xiaofeng Lin under supervision of Dr.Baharan Mirzasoleiman. 

This project aims for improve training performance of Coreset for Accelerating Increment Gradient descent(CRAIG) algorithm. The essential part of the modification involves replacing the logits(forward pass output - target) with per example gradients on neurons/connections selected by Early Bird Ticket or Gradient Signal Preservation algorithm.
